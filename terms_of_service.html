                    "us",
                    "author") . The Service is provided by the author at no cost and is intended for use as is. You can
                    contact the
                    author by sending email to bimber.service@gmail.com
                </p>
                <p><strong>Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement. </strong></p>
                <p>By creating a Bimber account , whether through a mobile device,mobile application or computer
                    (collectively, the
                    “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii)
                    our Privacy Policy each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. If you do not
                    accept and
                    agree to
                    be bound by all of the terms of thisAgreement, please do not use the Service.

                    We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Services from time to time. We may do this for a
                    variety of
                    reasons
                    including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business
                    practices. The
                    most
                    recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Services under your Profile and also on
                    bimber.fun, and
                    you
                    should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version that
                    applies. If the
                    changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in
                    advance of the
                    changes by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Services or via email. If
                    you continue
                    to
                    use the Services after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.</p>

                <p><strong>Your Account</strong></p>
                <p>In order to use Bimber, you may sign in using your Facebook or Google ("Auth provider") login. If you
                    do so, you
                    authorize us to access and use certain Auth provider account information, including but not limited
                    to your
                    public
                    profile. For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it,
                    please consult

                    Privacy Policy.

                    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up
                    for Bimber,
                    and
                    you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials. If you think
                    someone has
                    gained
                    access to your account, please immediately contact bimber.service@gmail.com.</p>

                <p><strong>Modifying the Services and Termination.</strong></p>
                <p>Bimber is always striving to improve the Services and bring you additional functionality that you
                    will find
                    engaging
                    and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as
                    remove some
                    features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not
                    provide you with
                    notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Services entirely, in which event we will notify
                    you in
                    advance
                    unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.

                    You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in
                    “Settings” in the
                    Service. Bimber may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have
                    violated
                    this Agreement.</p>

                <p><strong>Safety; Your Interactions with Other Users.</strong></p>
                <p>Though Bimber strives to encourage a respectful user experience through features like the double
                    opt-in that only
                    allows users to communicate if they have both indicated interest in one another, it is not
                    responsible for the
                    conduct of any user on or off of the Services. You agree to use caution in all interactions with
                    other users,
                    particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. You should not provide
                    your
                    financial information (for example, your credit card or bank account information), or wire or
                    otherwise send
                    money,
                    to other users.</p>

                <p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BIMBER DOES
                    NOT CONDUCT
                    CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS.
                    BIMBER MAKES NO
                    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF USERS. BIMBER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY
                    CRIMINAL
                    BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING
                    AVAILABLE PUBLIC
                    RECORDS.</p>
